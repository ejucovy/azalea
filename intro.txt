The site is served on a single Paste Deploy configuration.

The applications are installed in a virtualenv.

The documents are all contained within a single top level
directory for the site. The root of that directory is a
checkout of a Bazaar repository.

The canonical Bazaar repository lives on the filesystem
but could move anywhere -- the checkout is the only thing
that interacts with the repository directly.

Labels used
-----------

/virtualenv_base/
/path_to/paste.ini
/checkout_dir/
${repository_url}

For unsolved-problems-in-egyptology.com,

 ${repository_url} = file:///repository_path/
 /path_to/ == /checkout_dir/../ == /repository_path/../

However this is extrinsic to the Azalea layout.
