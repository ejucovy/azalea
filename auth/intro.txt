The filesystem layout herein will describe the authorization policies
that are applied to incoming requests to various URL paths for the
site.

Unless otherwise noted, authorization policies are acquired by all
sub-resources, so:

 * if bar.foo.com/foo requires REMOTE_USER then so will
   bar.foo.com/foo/baz
 * if bar.foo.com requires REMOTE_USER then so too shall
   bar.foo.com/foo

Labels:

foo.com: the site's top-level domain
