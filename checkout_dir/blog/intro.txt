This directory contains user blogs.

Each subdirectory within this directory represents a single user's blog.

The name of a subdirectory matches the name of the user whose blog it is.

Bitsyblog reads these files; none of this data is published directly to
the web.

Currently Azalea only provides a single blog, for the site's webmaster,
so /webmaster/ is currently the only subdirectory here.
