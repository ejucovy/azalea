/.password
/.secret
 The user's hashed password and shared secret string, used for 
 authentication.

/preferences.txt
 The user's blog preferences -- datestamp format, stylesheets, etc.

/css/
 Stylesheets available for the user's blog. Currently none are provided.
 But if you drop a css file in this directory, it should become available
 as a choice in the bitsyblog preferences screen.

/entries/
 The blog entries. Bitsyblog reads and writes to this directory. You
 can also write entries to this directory yourself without going through
 bitsyblog; as long as they are properly formatted on the filesystem,
 bitsyblog will happily publish any files it sees in here.
