I don't want .password and .secret to be here.

 * bitsyblog should take some piece of configuration to tell it
   where to look for the user's auth data (both for reading and
   writing, though we don't really use it for writing)

 * do we even need .secret -- need to research this.

Note though that this shouldn't be a security leak even though it
feels like one, because Azalea will not directly publish any of
the files under /blog/ to the web.

But the user can conceivably access and write to these in the site's
edit mode, which would break his ability to log in until a syadmin
intervenes. So they should live outside the editable scope, i.e.
outside of /checkout_dir/ altogether.
